@article{ALMA,
	Abstract = {{Several studies have shown that 50--70\% of the total lifecycle cost for a software system is spent on evolving the system. Organizations aim to reduce the cost of these adaptations, by addressing modifiability during the system's development. The software architecture plays an important role in achieving this, but few methods for architecture-level modifiability analysis exist. Independently, the authors have been working on scenario-based software architecture analysis methods that focus exclusively on modifiability. Combining these methods led to architecture-level modifiability analysis (ALMA), a unified architecture-level analysis method that focuses on modifiability, distinguishes multiple analysis goals, has explicit assumptions and provides repeatable techniques for performing the steps. ALMA consists of five main steps, i.e. goal selection, software architecture description, change scenario elicitation, change scenario evaluation and interpretation. The method has been validated through its application in several cases, including software architectures at Ericsson Software Technology, DFDS Fraktarna, Althin Medical, the Dutch Department of Defense and the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration.}},

@book{Principles_Trx_Processing,
	Abstract = {{What do reserving a seat on an airplane, buying a movie ticket over the
Internet, and launching a missile all have in common? \_Principles of
Transaction Processing for the Systems Professional\_ explains that these and
many other computerized tasks require the use of transaction processing (TP).
Authors Philip Bernstein and Eric Newcomer demonstrate that this previously
specialized area of systems design is becoming more important with the growth
of Internet commerce. This theoretically astute and practical-minded book
begins with a description of the principles of successful transaction
management. (The so-called "ACID" test requires that transactions be
atomistic, consistent, isolated, and durable.) The authors illustrate the
principles with real-world examples of transactions in everyday life, such as
ATM systems and the stock market. Bernstein and Newcomer then outline how
transaction processing monitors work and discuss some of the details, such as
interface definition languages, which let disparate computers communicate, and
remote procedure calls.

The text also explores some real-world TP monitor products, from IBM's CICS to
Tuxedo to Microsoft Transaction Server. While transaction processing has been
a part of mainframe system design for decades, it has recently become relevant
for commerce and everyday database access on the Web. The authors look at
today's Web servers--Microsoft Internet Information Server and Netscape's
FastTrack Server--and show how they manage transactions. Additional chapters
move back into the theoretical, with descriptions of database transactions and
strategies for replicating data. The text finishes up with some predictions on
where this vital and established technology is headed. This book is a must for
any developer who is designing a Web site that connects users to data in a
distributed environment. It's also a definitive guide to an intriguing area of
computing.}},

@book{GOF,
	Abstract = {{\_Design Patterns\_ is based on the idea that there are only so many design
problems in computer programming. This book identifies some common program-
design problems--such as adapting the interface of one object to that of
another object or notifying an object of a change in another object's state--
and explains the best ways (not always the obvious ways) that the authors know
to solve them. The idea is that you can use the authors' sophisticated design
ideas to solve problems that you often waste time solving over and over again
in your own programming.

The authors have come up with some ingenious ways to solve some common
vexations among object-oriented programmers. Want to build a page-layout
program that embeds inline images among characters of various sizes? How about
building a program that converts files of one format to another? Chances are,
some programmer already has thought of a better solution than you will and the
recipes you need are here. Solutions are presented in generalised diagrams of
data and logic structures. The idea is that you can take the concepts
presented here and adapt them--in whatever language you use--to your
individual situation. You may have to read some of the chapters several times
before you fully understand them, but when you find a solution in this book,
it will make your job easier and your results more elegant. --\_Jake Bond\_}},

	Abstract = {{Three significant trends have underscored the central role of concurrency in computing. First, there is increased use of interacting processes by individual users, for example, application programs running on X windows. Second, workstation networks have become a cost-effective mechanism for resource sharing and distributed problem solving. For example, loosely coupled problems, such as finding all the factors of large prime numbers, have been solved by utilizing ideal cycles on networks of hundreds of workstations. A loosely coupled problem is one which can be easily partitioned into many smaller subproblems so that interactions between the subproblems is quite limited. Finally, multiprocessor technology has advanced to the point of providing supercomputing power at a fraction of the traditional cost. At the same time, software engineering considerations such as the need for data abstraction to promote program modularity underlie the rapid acceptance of object-oriented programming methodology. By separating the specification of what is done (the abstraction) from how it is done (the implementation), the concept of objects provides modularity necessary for programming in the large. It turns out that concurrency is a natural consequence of the concept of objects. In fact Simula, the first object-oriented language, simulated a simple form of concurrency using coroutines on conventional architectures. Current development of concurrent object-oriented programming (COOP) is providing a solid software foundation for concurrent computing on multiprocessors, Future generation computing systems are likely to be based on the foundations being developed by this emerging software technology. The goal of this article is to discuss the foundations and methodology of COOP. Concurrency refers to the potentially parallel execution of parts of a computation. In a concurrent computation, the components of a program may be executed sequentially, or they may be executed in parallel. Concurrency provides us with the flexibility to interleave the execution of components of a program on a single processor, or to distribute it among several processors. Concurrency abstracts away some of the details in an execution, allowing us to concentrate on conceptual issues without having to be concerned with a particular order of execution which may result from the quirks of a given system. Objects can be defined as entities which encapsulate data and operations into a single computational unit. Object models differ in how the internal behavior of objects is specified. Further, models of concurrent computation based on objects must specify how the objects interact, and different design concerns have led to different models of communication between objects. Object-oriented programming builds on the concepts of objects by supporting patterns of reuse and classification, for example, through the use of inheritance which allows all instances of a particular class to share the same method. In the following section, we outline some common patterns of concurrent problem solving. These patterns can be easily expressed in terms of the rich variety of structures provided by COOP. In particular, we discuss the actor model as a framework for concurrent systems 1  and some concepts which are useful in building actor systems. We will then describe some other models of objects and their relation to the actor model along with novel techniques for supporting reusability and modularity in concurrent object-oriented programming. The last section briefly outlines some major on-going projects in COOP. It is important to note that the actor languages give special emphasis to developing flexible program structures which simplify reasoning about programs. By reasoning we do not narrowly restrict ourselves to the problem of program verification\&mdash;an important program of research whose direct practical utility has yet to be established. Rather our interest is in the ability to understand the properties of software because of clarity in the structure of the code. Such an understanding may be gained by reasoning either informally or formally about programs. The ease with which we can carry out such reasoning is aided by two factors: by modularity in code which is the result of the ability to separate design concerns, and by the ability to abstract program structures which occur repeatedly. In particular, because of their flexible structure, actor languages are particularly well-suited to rapid prototyping applications.}},

Then again, critics and those who programmed using in a pure actor-based style will note the functional style which may get in the way of real programs.},
